# HadoopApp

Description: A simple app for searching food by name. In the app, there are two choices to search for food: 'By Calories By Gram' or 'List Of Breakfast'. If the first option is chosen, we can search for food based on maximum sugar content, minimum protein content, and determine maximum calories.
The other choice is to search for food using the list of breakfast items.
In this option, we can filter the food list based on maximum sugar content and minimum protein content. The text field for maximum calories
is deactivated. When we enter the food name and apply other filters, upon clicking the search button, the results are displayed in the results box located at the bottom of the search interface.

The backend of the app operates with Hadoop, a framework that supports the processing of large datasets. Hadoop utilizes components such as MapReduce, which is a programming model for processing and generating large datasets using parallel distributed algorithms in a cluster. The 'Map' procedure is responsible for performing filtering and sorting, while the 'Reducer' counts the number of foods in each category, thus obtaining the frequency of occurrence of food names."

Technologies used: Hadoop, Java, JFrame.
