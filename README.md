# HadoopApp

Description: Simple app for searching food by name. In the app we have two choises to search food by Calories By Gram or List Of Breakfast, if the first option is chosen we can search food by maximum sugar content, minimum protein content and determines maximum calories.
The other choise is to search food by list of breakfast in this choise we can filter food list with only maximum sugar content, minimum protein content, the textfield for maximum calories is deactivated. When we add food name and other filters and press search the results are showed in the results box which appears at the bottom of the search button. 
The backend of the app work with Hadoop (Hadoop is framework  which supports processing of large data sets, things that hadoop uses are MapReduce which is program model for processing and generate large datasets with parallel distributed algorithm in a cluster Map: a procedure that performs filtering and sorting and Reducer count the number of foods in each queue, obtaining frequency of occurrence of names )
